## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
library(data.table)

fread("./data/mayorsfoodcourt.csv", stringsAsFactors=F) -> food_viola
head(food_viola)
```

```{r}
print(unique(food_viola$DESCRIPT))
print(unique(food_viola$ViolLevel))
```

```{r}
library(magrittr)
library(plyr)


filtered <- dplyr::filter(food_viola, ViolStatus == 'Fail' & Location != '')
filteredp <- dplyr::filter(food_viola, ViolStatus == 'Pass' & Location != '')

df <- ddply(filtered,
            .(businessName, LegalOwner, NameLast, NameFirst, LICENSENO, DESCRIPT, Address, CITY, STATE, ZIP, Location),
            summarise,
            Severity = length(businessName))

pf <- ddply(filteredp,
            .(businessName),
            summarise,
            Positivity = length(businessName))
```

```{r}
df <- merge(df,pf,by="businessName")
head(df)
```

```{r}
df <- df %>% tidyr::extract(Location, c("lat", "lng"), "\\(([^,]+), ([^)]+)\\)")

```


```{r}
write.table(df, file = "./data/FoodViolationData.csv", sep=",",row.names=FALSE)
```
